# JARVIS

## Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

The goal of this project is to try to reproduce JARVIS, the AI from the Iron Man series. 

We are trying to achieve this using the GPT-3 technology by OpenAI, and combining it with Text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies.

Therefore, this project is coded in python and uses the OpenAI API.
